domain.
## Abstract:
The subject of the study investigates the security of authentication systems in the Active Directory domain. The aim is to identify potential threats to the security of authentication to teleinformatics systems, in which devices are connected to the Active Directory domain. To realize the work, an exemplary infrastructure was implemented and its security tests were carried out. As a result of the analysis, the following threats to the security of authentication in the Active Directory domain were identified: brute force attacks, the use of weak passwords, attacks on Domain Name System and attacks using incorrect configuration of the Kerberos protocol. The analysis of the effectiveness of current protection mechanisms indicated that existing solutions are effective in preventing most of the identified threats but appropriate configuration and adaptation of the system to the specific needs of the organization by the administrator is required. The study also proposes corrective actions which increased the level of security of the implemented infrastructure. However the recommendations can be considered as a more universal set of good practices for designing a system based on the Active Directory service.
